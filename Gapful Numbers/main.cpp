int main()
{
    // Algorithm to Solve this problem
    /*
     - first we get a number from a user
     - then we change the number to a string
     - then we store the first char with the last char of the string
     - change the char to a string and divide the original number with this string
        - if it has no remainder, then return true
        - else return false
